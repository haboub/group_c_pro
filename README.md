# Project: Computational Efficiency in Early Warning Systems for Financial Credit Risk.

An Early Warning System (EWS) is a tool used in the financial industry to find loan credit risks and early signs of financial problems. It looks at past data, current financial information, and economic conditions to predict which clients may become risky in the future.

The system uses information like transaction histories, financial ratios, credit scores, and economic factors to help financial institutions manage risks. But as the data becomes bigger, the system needs better methods to work faster and stay reliable.

## Objectives

The goal of this project is to solve the problem of slow processing caused by large amounts of data in Early Warning Systems (EWS). This happens because matrix inversion, a key step in the model, becomes inefficient when data grows.
