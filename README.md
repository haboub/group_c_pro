# Early Warning System for Loan Credit Risk

This project, part of MATH-557 (Applied Linear Algebra), explores the use of numerical linear algebra techniques in developing an Early Warning System (EWS) for detecting loan credit risk and financial distress. The system analyzes historical data, financial information, and economic conditions to predict potential risks effectively.

This project provides tools for analyzing financial data, implementing machine learning models, and evaluating results using metrics like accuracy, precision, and recall. It demonstrates the use of logistic regression for classification and Cholesky decomposition for efficient linear algebra computations.
